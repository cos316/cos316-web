## Deliverables

* A write-up of your project, at most 5-page, single-spaced, 11pt font, 1 inch
  margins. Write-ups should include a description of your project goal,
  describe the design and implementation of your system, and a relevant
  performance evaluation.

* A 5-minute video describing your project. Where relevant you may show a demo
  of your implementation.

* All project code along with instructions necessary to compile and run your
  system.

## Grading

The final project will be evaluated on two broad categories:

  1. **Scope**: The scope of your project will determine the maximum grade you can
     receive. For examples of projects that would receive full points for scope
     (and therefore have a maximum possible grade of 100%), see below.

  2. **Execution**: How well you deliver on the promised scope of your project. This
     includes the video, write-up, and code deliverables and determines your
     final grade on the assignment.

At least one person from each group must attend their precept to double check
for your project to be approved and assigned a maximum grade for the scope.

## Example Projects

Here are 8 example projects and their maximum grade:

1. Extending assignment 4 (DORM) to support arbitrary SQL queries. _Max grade 85%_
2. Implementing and evaluating a non-queue-based caching algorithm. Examples of such algorithms include: LIRS, ARCS, and Hyperbolic. _Max grade 85%_

3. Implementing and evaluating a machine learning-based caching algorithm. Examples you could use for inspiration include: Cacheus, LRB, and LeCaR - _Max grade 85%_

4. Building a shell in Go (or another language of your choice) that supports process backgrounding. See this page for help/guidance getting started on implementing a linux shell - _Max grade up to 100%, depending on completeness of shell_

5. Build a browser plugin that does something cool. There are lots of options here: analyzing a user’s traffic, encrypting/decrypting form inputs, etc - _Max grade up to 100%, depending on creativity and implementation difficulty_

6. Build an IPTables-like application in Go. See the Basic Concepts section on this page for an overview of what IPTables does. You do not need to replicate all this functionality - a very basic firewall will suffice. - _Max grade up to 100%_

7. Build a cache for some other medium such as a file system, SSD, or Hard Drive - _Max grade up to to 100% depending on details_

## FAQs

### I want to do one of the example projects but don’t know how to get started!

Come to office hours, make an Ed Post, or send us an email! We’re happy to help you get off the ground.

### How much work should we put into the final project?

About twice as much as the average programming assignment.

### Does our project fulfill the expected scope for the course?

Come to precept and we’ll tell you

### I want to work on a project that isn’t included in the examples

Please do! Get approval from your preceptor

### What should we include in our video?

The video should be 5 minutes or shorter, should include a screen share
demonstrating your project's functionality (if applicable), and explain how and
why it works. If you want to show specific code snippets that’s fine as well.
The goal is for you to show us that you built something systems-y that works.
