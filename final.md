## Final Project

Your final project is to build some new system functionality. It is open-ended,
you get to define your project. Its scope should be about twice what you've done
in each of the programming assignments throughout the course. You can work in a
group of 2 or 3, or individually with prior approval.

In your project you can build a new system, modify or evaluate an existing real
system, or _significantly_ extend one of the programming assignments. Our
wonderful TAs will help you select and refine your final project topic during
precepts.

### Deliverables

You will have three deliverables due on Dean's Date: 5pm Princeton Time on TBD. They are:
1. A tarball with your code and tests.
2. A 2-page project report (single-spaced, 1-inch margins, 11pt font).
3. A video demo of your project that is 5 minutes or less.

**Tarball** Your tarball should contain all of your code, including your tests.
If your code is in a directory called `code`, you can create a tarball with this
command while in the parent directory: `tar -czvf code.tgz code`.

**Project Report**
Your 2 page project report must include the following 4 sections:
1. Project description. Briefly describe the base system you are modifying, the
   new functionality you are adding, and your rationale for why you wanted to
   add that new functionality. If you are building a system from scratch,
   describe its purpose and the problem it should help solve.
2. Design overview. Briefly describe the design of your new functionality or new
   system. This should be explained in sufficient for someone who has taken COS
   316 to be able to understand why you chose to design things they you did, but
   need not include implementation choices that are either not important or
   should be obvious given the design. This section can, and should, rely
   heavily on the principles discussed in class (naming, caching, concurrency,
   resource allocation, security, etc).
3. Testing methodology. Briefly describe your methodology for testing your new
   functionality or system.
4. Outcome. Describe the outcome of your project. Was it fully successful or
   partially successful? What works completely, what works mostly, and what
   doesn't work?

**Video Demo** Your video demo should be at most 5 minutes long. (Shorter is
fine.) It should show your code running with you explaining what is happening.
One easy way to record this video is in a zoom meeting by yourself, see
instructions from Zoom

### Submission

You will submit your deliverables using TBD.
