video conference and an Ed discussion board.

  * [Ed discussion board]
  * Links for the
    [lecture](https://us.edstem.org/courses/2353/discussion/113925) and precept
    video conferences are accessible to
    registered students on the Ed discussion board.

**Description.** This course teaches students the design,
implementation, and evaluation of computer systems, including operating
systems, networking, and distributed systems.The course will teach
students to evaluate the performance and study the design choices of
existing systems. Students will also learn general systems concepts that
support design goals of modularity, performance, and security. Students
will apply materials learned in lectures and readings to design, build
and evaluate new systems components.

**Textbook.** There is no required textbook in this course, because
there is no one book that covers the right material in an up-to-date
fashion. Some required articles/papers/blogs/etc. will be posted
on-line.

**Grading.**
Being finalized, check back soon.
