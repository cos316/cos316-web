Welcome to the homepage for COS 316, Principles of Computer System
Design, Fall 2020.

**Description.** This course teaches students the design,
implementation, and evaluation of computer systems, including operating
systems, networking, and distributed systems.The course will teach
students to evaluate the performance and study the design choices of
existing systems. Students will also learn general systems concepts that
support design goals of modularity, performance, and security. Students
will apply materials learned in lectures and readings to design, build
and evaluate new systems components.

**Textbook.** There is no required textbook in this course, because
there is no one book that covers the right material in an up-to-date
fashion. Some required articles/papers/blogs/etc. will be posted
on-line. We also suggest the following textbook:

Principles of Computer System Design by M. Frans Kaashoek, Jerome H.
Saltzer. Morgan Kaufmann. May 2009

An online version of the textbook is available at [Association of
Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://acm.org), which is available to all
student members. Membership (\$19) in ACM also provides access to a wide
variety of other resources, such as textbooks and videos on the Go
programming language and the Git distributed version control system.

**Grading.** Assignments - 50%; Final Project - 10%; Two Exams - 30%;
Potential Problem Sets - 10%
