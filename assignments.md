title: Programming Assignments and Problem Sets
layout: default

## Overview

Course evaluation consists of programming assignments and problem sets,
generally due on alternating weeks, as well as a [final project](/final).

Problem sets review material from lecture and must be done **individually**.
They are to be completed on Gradescope and will be posted to the [Ed Discussion
Board](https://edstem.org/us/courses/19325).

Programming assignments put the ideas from lecture into practice by building
components of a web framework. All programming assignments must be done in
groups of two partners, **except** assignment 0 (setting up your development
environment), which should be done individually.

**Regrades:** If you feel we have made a mistake while grading your
work, email your preceptor with a short note describing the potential
mistake. You must do this within two weeks of the work being returned.

**Late days:** You may use up to seven (7) late days for programming
assignments. The late days are assigned retroactively to give you the
best possible overall grade on your programming
assignments. Programming assignments are due at 11:00pm Princeton
Time. Your score for one programming assignment is the commit with the
highest graded score and valid submission time. You do not declare the
use of late days. At the end of the semester, we find the best
allocation of late days across all your programming assignments, such
that all your submissions sum to the highest score.

You may not use late days for problem sets and the Dean\'s Date project

Late assignment penalties will be waived only in the case of
unforeseeable circumstances like medical emergencies, as documented by
your Dean or Director of Studies and with our approval.

## Programming Assignments

You will complete programming assignments in groups of two (except assignment
0), using Git to collaborate. We will automatically grade the last commit _each
time you push_ to your group's GitHub repository and report the grade as a
GitHub comment on the commit. At the end of the semester, we will assign you the
highest grade obtained for each assignment, considering the late day allocation
described above.

In other words, there is no penalty for pushing regularly to your repository,
and you should know within a few minutes how much of the assignment you've
successfully completed.

To begin working on a released assignment, using the assignment [dashbaord](/dashboard).

## Collaboration Policy

This course permits many forms of collaboration, including help from
course staff, classmates, and lab TAs. Googling is allowed, even
encouraged, in this course. You may use any online resource as long as
you cite the source (e.g., including the URL of source in the code).

Here is a summary, where ✔ means YES and ❌ means NO. If you have any
questions, please contact the course staff. Note the summer refers to
*Groups* - when you are working on an *individual* assignment, your
group consists of one - yourself.

**Your solutions.** The term *solutions* refers to any of the products
created when completing an, such as source code (including comments) and
documentation. It includes both finished and unfinished products,
regardless of correctness or completeness.

-   You must never expose solutions to anyone who is taking COS 316 now
    or who might take COS 316 in the future.
-   If you leave your computer unattended, be sure to protect it with a
    password.
-   You must never receive or view someone else\'s solutions to a
    programming assignment (or variant of an assignment).

**Working Groups.** All programming assignments require you to work in
groups. Here are the rules regarding group work.

-   A group must consist of two students.
-   You can work in different groups on different programming
    assignments.
-   Each group should submit a single solution, which should be clearly
    labeled with the names of the group\'s members. Only one member of
    the group needs to submit the group\'s solution. There is no need to
    submit redundant copies for the other members.
-   The members of a group will all receive the same grade on an
    programming assignment, reflecting the quality of the group\'s
    collective solution to the programming assignment.
-   It is up to you to divide up the work within your group, and to make
    sure that the other members of your group meet their commitments.
    (If a member of your group is consistently irresponsible, let us
    know and we\'ll take appropriate action.)
-   If you have trouble finding a group, let us know and we will help
    you.

**Why Work in Groups?** There are several reasons for our decision to
make you work in groups.

-   In the real world, people work in groups. We want you to learn how.
-   Designing, implementing and evaluating systems requires you to deal
    with engineering tradeoffs and make difficult design decisions. We
    hope that you\'ll debate these decisions within your group, and that
    the debates will be educational.

**Plagiarism.** As members of the University community, students are
bound by the rules and procedures described in [Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities](http://www.princeton.edu/pub/rrr/).

All the rules above continue to apply after assignments are graded and
after the end of the semester.
