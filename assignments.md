title: Programming Assignments and Problem Sets
layout: default
---

Programming assignments will be published, submitted and testing using
[GitHub](https://github.com). You will need to create a GitHub account
using your Princeton email address.

All problem sets (PSETS) must be done **individually**.

All programming assignments must be done in groups of two partners.

There is a (final project)[/final], which is due on Dean\'s Date: December 8, 2020 at 5:00pm Princeton Time.

**Regrades:** If you feel we have made a mistake while grading your
work, email your preceptor with a short note describing the potential
mistake. You must do this within two weeks of the work being returned.

**Late days:** You may use up to seven (7) late days for programming
assignments. The late days are assigned retroactively to give you the
best possible overall grade on your programming
assignments. Programming assignments are due at 11:00pm Princeton
Time. Your score for one programming assignment is the commit with the
highest graded score and valid submission time. You do not declare the
use of late days. At the end of the semester, we find the best
allocation of late days across all your programming assignments, such
that all your submissions sum to the highest score.

You may not use late days for problem sets and the Dean\'s Date project

Late assignment penalties will be waived only in the case of
unforeseeable circumstances like medical emergencies, as documented by
your Dean or Director of Studies and with our approval.

## Collaboration Policy

This course permits many forms of collaboration, including help from
course staff, classmates, and lab TAs. Googling is allowed, even
encouraged, in this course. You may use any online resource as long as
you cite the source (e.g., including the URL of source in the code).

Here is a summary, where ✔ means YES and ❌ means NO. If you have any
questions, please contact the course staff. Note the summer refers to
*Groups* - when you are working on an *individual* assignment, your
group consists of one - yourself.

**Your solutions.** The term *solutions* refers to any of the products
created when completing an, such as source code (including comments) and
documentation. It includes both finished and unfinished products,
regardless of correctness or completeness.

-   You must never expose solutions to anyone who is taking COS 316 now
    or who might take COS 316 in the future.
-   If you leave your computer unattended, be sure to protect it with a
    password.
-   You must never receive or view someone else\'s solutions to a
    programming assignment (or variant of an assignment).

**Working Groups.** All programming assignments require you to work in
groups. Here are the rules regarding group work.

-   A group must consist of two students.
-   You can work in different groups on different programming
    assignments.
-   Each group should submit a single solution, which should be clearly
    labeled with the names of the group\'s members. Only one member of
    the group needs to submit the group\'s solution. There is no need to
    submit redundant copies for the other members.
-   The members of a group will all receive the same grade on an
    programming assignment, reflecting the quality of the group\'s
    collective solution to the programming assignment.
-   It is up to you to divide up the work within your group, and to make
    sure that the other members of your group meet their commitments.
    (If a member of your group is consistently irresponsible, let us
    know and we\'ll take appropriate action.)
-   If you have trouble finding a group, let us know and we will help
    you.

**Why Work in Groups?** There are several reasons for our decision to
make you work in groups.

-   In the real world, people work in groups. We want you to learn how.
-   Designing, implementing and evaluating systems requires you to deal
    with engineering tradeoffs and make difficult design decisions. We
    hope that you\'ll debate these decisions within your group, and that
    the debates will be educational.

**Plagiarism.** As members of the University community, students are
bound by the rules and procedures described in [Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities](http://www.princeton.edu/pub/rrr/).

All the rules above continue to apply after assignments are graded and
after the end of the semester.
