## Grading

Course evaluation consists of programming assignments and problem sets,
generally due on alternating weeks, as well as two design prompts and a final
project. For more information on the schedule, see [Assignments]({% link
assignments.md %}). Note that the schedules on the website are preliminary and
subject to change. In case of a mismatch between this document or the
information available on the website and announcements by course staff, the
latter shall prevail.

- Problem sets review material from lecture and must be done
  **individually**. They are to be completed on Gradescope and will be posted to
  the [Ed Discussion Board](https://edstem.org/us/courses/45565).

- Programming assignments put the ideas from lecture into practice by building
  components of a web framework. All programming assignments must be done in
  pairs (groups of two).

**Regrades:** If you feel we have made a mistake while grading your work, email
your preceptor with a short note describing the potential mistake. You must do
this within two weeks of the work being returned.

**Late days:** You may use up to seven (7) late days for programming
assignments. The late days are assigned retroactively to give you the best
possible overall grade on your programming assignments.  Programming assignments
are due at 11:00pm Eastern (Princeton) time.  This is a hard deadline; a
submission at 11:02pm will count as one full late day. Your score for one
programming assignment is the commit with the highest graded score and valid
submission time. You do not declare the use of late days. At the end of the
semester, we find the best allocation of late days across all your programming
assignments, such that all your submissions sum to the highest score.

You may not use late days for problem sets and the Dean\'s Date project

Late assignment penalties will be waived only in the case of unforeseeable
circumstances like medical emergencies, as documented by your Dean or Director
of Studies and with our approval.

The course grade will be composed as follows:

| Percentage | Contribution            | Details                                   |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 50%        | Programming Assignments | 5 total, 10% each                         |
| 20%        | Problem Sets            | 5 total, 4% each                          |
| 10%        | Design Prompts          | 2 total, skewed mostly towards 2nd prompt |
| 20%        | Final Project           |                                           |

We do not anticipate applying a grading curve. **In no case** will grades be
curved down (i.e., 93% will always translate to an A).

## Assignment Policies

The following sections provide an overview over the course's assignment and
collaboration policies. [Lecture 2]({% link lectures/L02-overview.pdf %})
discusses the course policies in detail. In case of a mismatch between this
document or the information available on the website and announcements by course
staff, the latter shall prevail.

### Programming Assignments

You will complete programming assignments in pairs (groups of two), using Git to
collaborate. We will automatically grade the last commit _each time you push_ to
your group's GitHub repository and report the grade as a GitHub comment on the
commit. At the end of the semester, we will assign you the highest grade
obtained for each assignment, considering the late day allocation described
above.

In other words, there is no penalty for pushing regularly to your repository,
and you should know within a few minutes how much of the assignment you've
successfully completed.

To begin working on a released assignment use the assignment <!-- [dashboard]({%
link dashboard.md %}). --> dashboard (to be activated...).


## Collaboration Policy

This course permits many forms of collaboration, including help from course
staff, classmates, and lab TAs. Googling is allowed and even encouraged in this
course. You may use any online resource as long as you cite the source (e.g.,
including the URL of source in the code).

Here is a summary, where ✔ means YES and ❌ means NO. If you have any questions,
please contact the course staff. Note the summer refers to *Groups* - when you
are working on an *individual* assignment, your group consists of one -
yourself.

|activity                             |your group\*  |course staff  |COS 316 grads  |classmates  |other

**Your solutions.** The term *solutions* refers to any of the products created
when completing an assignment, such as source code (including comments) and
documentation. It includes both finished and unfinished products, regardless of
correctness or completeness.

-   You must never expose solutions to anyone who is taking COS 316 now or who
    might take COS 316 in the future.
-   If you leave your computer unattended, be sure to protect it with a
    password.
-   You must never receive or view someone else\'s solutions to a programming
    assignment (or variant of an assignment).

**Working in Groups.** All programming assignments require you to work in
groups. Here are the rules regarding group work.

-   A group must consist of two students.
-   You can work in different groups on different programming assignments.
-   Each group should submit a single solution, which should be clearly labeled
    with the names of the group\'s members. Only one member of the group needs
    to submit the group\'s solution. There is no need to submit redundant copies
    for the other members.
-   The members of a group will all receive the same grade on a programming
    assignment, reflecting the quality of the group\'s collective solution to
    the programming assignment.
-   It is up to you to divide up the work within your group, and to make sure
    that the other members of your group meet their commitments.  (If a member
    of your group is consistently irresponsible, let us know and we\'ll take
    appropriate action.)
-   If you have trouble finding a group, let us know and we will help you.

**Why Work in Groups?** There are several reasons for our decision to make you
work in groups.

-   In the real world, people work in groups. We want you to learn how.
-   Designing, implementing and evaluating systems requires you to deal with
    engineering tradeoffs and make difficult design decisions. We hope that
    you\'ll debate these decisions within your group, and that the debates will
    be educational.

**Plagiarism.** As members of the University community, students are bound by
the rules and procedures described in [Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities](http://www.princeton.edu/pub/rrr/).

All the rules above continue to apply after assignments are graded and after the
end of the semester.
